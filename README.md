## Description
It is my intention that whoever will visit my site will be inspired to check out the various styles I have implemented in terms of creating beautiful and 
eye atching Graphical User Interface(GUI). By that very means, whoever would like to work with me in the process of creating a website is highly welcome.
All the sites I have done are meant to showcase the power of using HTML and CSS to come up with an eye catching User Interface.


## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Text Editor such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.
* Knowledge of CSS.
* Linux System.
* If one is on windows, one may install Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL).
* A good internet connection may be required since some attached videos are from online resources.
* A good web browser that can clearly display HTML5 features.



## Known Bugs
At times when the internet is slow, it may take time for the videos and photos attached to load. In such instances, you may need to use a WIFI system or if possible use a SIM network that has a high quality band width. Otherwise, you may have to bear with the slow internet speeds.


## Technologies Used
HTML5
-This enabled me to create better data validation points for the input, without necessarily using a scripting language such as Python or Javascript or PHP.
This is in the case when a user is required to enter his name or email address.
CSS3
-This allowed me to have a better command over the styling of the main outlook of the whole HTML page. It greatly enhanced my GUI.
JavaScript
-This came in handy to ensure responsivity of the navigation bar  and to better handle smaller screens by not showing the navigation bar, but simply an impressivee menu ICON.
